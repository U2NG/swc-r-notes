## Introduction
The scientific process is naturally incremental, and many projects start life as random notes, some code, then a manuscript, and eventually everything is a bit mixed together.

### Finder/Explorer Example

Most people tend to organize their projects like this:

![image](images/bad_layout.png)

*There are many reasons why we should ALWAYS avoid this:*

1. It is really hard to tell which version of your data is the original and which is the modified;
2. It gets really messy because it mixes files with various extensions together;
3. It probably takes you a lot of time to actually find things, and relate the correct figures to the exact code that has been used to generate it

**A good project layout will ultimately make your life easier:**
* It will help ensure the integrity of your data;
* It makes it simpler to share your code with someone else (a lab-mate, collaborator, or supervisor);
* It allows you to easily upload your code with your manuscript submission;
* It makes it easier to pick the project back up after a break.


## A Possible Solution

* There are tools and packages in RStudio to help you manage your work effectively.

* Most powerful and useful aspects of RStudio is its project management functionality

* let's create a self-contained, reproducible project.

### Challenge: create a self-contained project

We’re going to create a new project in RStudio:

1. Click the “File” menu button, then “New Project”.
2. Click “New Directory”.
3. Click “Empty Project”.
4. Type in the name of the directory to store your project, e.g. “my_project”.
5. If available, select the checkbox for “Create a git repository.”
6. Click the “Create Project” button.

* When you start R in this project directory, or open this project with RStudio, all of our work on this project will be entirely self-contained in this directory.

## Best practices for project organization

1. Treat data as read only - most important goal of setting up a project

2. Data Cleaning - In many cases your data will be “dirty”: it will need significant preprocessing to get into a format R (or any other programming language) will find useful. This task is sometimes called “data munging”.
store these scripts in a separate folder, and create a second “read-only” data folder to hold the “cleaned” data sets.

3. Treat generated output as disposable - Anything generated by your scripts should be treated as disposable: it should all be able to be regenerated from your scripts.

**Tip: Good Enough Practices for Scientific Computing**    
https://github.com/swcarpentry/good-enough-practices-in-scientific-computing/blob/gh-pages/good-enough-practices-for-scientific-computing.pdf

1. Put each project in its own directory, which is named after the project.
2. Put text documents associated with the project in the doc directory.
3. Put raw data and metadata in the data directory, and files generated during 4. cleanup and analysis in a results directory.
4. Put source for the project’s scripts and programs in the src directory, and programs brought in from elsewhere or compiled locally in the bin directory.
5. Name all files to reflect their content or function.

### Download gapminder data
## Save the data in the data directory
Now we have a good directory structure we will now place/save the data file in the data/ directory.

Download the gapminder data from here.     
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/resbaz/r-novice-gapminder-files/master/data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv

1. Download the file (CTRL + S, right mouse click -> “Save as”, or File -> “Save page as”)
2. Make sure it’s saved under the name gapminder-FiveYearData.csv
3. Save the file in the data/ folder within your project.
We will load and inspect these data later.

### talk about gapminder data 

For each of 142
countries, the package provides values for life expectancy, GDP per capita,
and population, every five years, from 1952 to 2007.
